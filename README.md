# PizzaClinicalTrial
Combining Spacey Pizza Dispatch And FDA Approved Clinical Trials

## Evaluation
This repo solves a given homework assigned by Koneksa for code form.  To run the code, just issue "make test" and all tests should pass.  All relevant code is evaluated using this mechanism and there is nothing to deploy.

The testing depends on having a recent version of Make and is best run on a Mac OS computer (tested 12.3.1 on M1 Max) or Linux (not tested).  No comment on running on Windows.

## Comments
I have included some code and testing patterns I generally produce and commit to git repos.
